Capitol Lost to Fissure
~~~
Due to gross negligence the Fissure Containment System on your capitol failed today. As a result the planet imploded and most of the population was lost.

Luckily the legislature was able to flee the planet in time, take a fast ship, and re-establish your capitol on %s, Hurrah!
