Shipyard
~~~
Now that you've got the Space Port you can start on the Shipyard. Your Shipyard will allow you to build ships so that you can explore the Expanse and even colonize other planets. Build the Shipyard now and we'll soon have you scouring the galaxy for more resources.  

Reply to me when your Shipyard is ready and I'll tell you what else needs to be done. I've just sent some more resources to you. They should arrive by the time your Shipyard is complete.

Regards,
