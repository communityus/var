Essentia
~~~
You may remember I told you that the entire Lacunan economy depends upon Essentia. I've just given you some of our precious supply. They'd kill me if they knew that I gave it to you.

Essentia is both rare and powerful. Our entire race spends their waking hours trying to acquire more. If you have it, you're the most powerful species in the Expanse. Essentia has rare properties that allow plants to grow more hearty and machinery to work more efficiently. It can even be used in various chemical processes to transform one element into another. It's the closest thing I've seen to magic. 

Spend some of the Essentia I've given you to boost your production of water, energy, food, and ore. Once you've done this reply to me.
