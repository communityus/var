Starving Citizens
~~~
I've gotten angry messages from citizens all day today about the lack of food on {Planet %s %s}. I also just received a report from the Security Minister that he arrested a group of citizens as they were breaking into the %s looking for food. Some damage was done to the building in the process.

Please do something quickly or I'm certain there will be more trouble.

Regards,

Your Humble Assistant
