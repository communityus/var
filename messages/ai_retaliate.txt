Retaliation!
~~~
We the DeLamberti salute you!

It has been some time now since one of our colonies was attacked and occupied. In the days leading up to the final battle much intelligence was gathered and taken off-planet. We have now processed that documentation and we have a clear picture of who is responsible.

Empires %s were primarily responsible, with Alliance assistance from, %s.

We will now make a show of our might against these empires and members of their alliances. Our response will be proportionate to the level of damage we believe they have been responsible for and for any technology of ours that they have stolen.

You may expect our response shortly.
