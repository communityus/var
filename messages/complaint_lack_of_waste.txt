Unions Unhappy About Job Loss
~~~
The workers union is making loud complaints about citizens being laid off from their jobs. Apparently they used to work at the %s on {Planet %s %s}, but have been laid off because there is not enough waste to be processed.

You should either close down the %s or start producing more waste to put these people back to work. If you don't do something soon this dissent could spread to the other workers.

When you have enough waste you'll need to repair the building to bring it up to full capacity again.
